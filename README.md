# Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

## Introduction
This project implements **Steganography** to securely hide data within images using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB) Substitution** method. It ensures confidential data transmission while remaining imperceptible to the human eye.

## Problem Statement
- With the rise of digital communication, **data security** and **privacy** are major concerns.


## Technologies Used
- **Steganography Techniques:** LSB Substitution
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:** OpenCV, PIL, NumPy, OS
- **Encryption:** AES for added security
- **Implementation:** Pixel modification for data embedding

## Features 
- **Invisible Data Storage**: The hidden data remains undetectable to the human eye.
- **Dual Security**: Combines steganography with AES encryption.
- **Versatile Applications**: Usable in watermarking, covert communication, and cybersecurity.
